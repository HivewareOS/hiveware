# Hiveware CLI Documentation

**Hiveware** is a command-line tool designed for managing Nix packages easily. It provides commands to install, uninstall, and interact with packages in a Nix shell. This document outlines the installation process and usage details for Hiveware.

## Installation Instructions

To install Hiveware, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system, as Hiveware is built using Rust. Follow these steps to get Hiveware up and running:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already installed Rust, you can do so using `rustup`. Open your terminal and run:

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

<br>

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You might need to restart your terminal or run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to start using Rust immediately.

2. **Verify Installation**: Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed correctly by running:

   ```sh
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

### Quickstart

Install `hiveware` via crates.io:

```sh
cargo install hiveware
```

```sh
hiveware install alacritty
```

### Clone and Build Hive

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Hiveware repository from GitHub:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HivewareOS/hiveware.git
   ```

<br>

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the cloned repository directory:

   ```sh
   cd hiveware
   ```

<br>

3. **Build the Project**: Compile the Hiveware tool using Cargo:

   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

   The compiled binary will be located in the `target/release` directory.

<br>

4. **Install the Binary**: Optionally, you can copy the binary to a directory in your system's PATH for easy execution. For example:

   ```sh
   cp target/release/hiveware /usr/local/bin/
   ```

   Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH. You might need `sudo` permissions to copy the binary.

<br>

5. To add the Cargo bin directory to your PATH, append the following line to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or equivalent shell configuration file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

After updating the file, reload your shell configuration with:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
